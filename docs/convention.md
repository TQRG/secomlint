# SECOM

Sometimes commit messages generated to document the patches/fixes of known vulnerabilities are either poorly documented or do not seem to be security-related. [SECOM](https://tqrg.github.io/secom/) is a convention for making security commit messages more readable and structured. It organizes several bits of security-related information from vulnerabilities and their respective patches. 

```markup
1   vuln-fix: subject/header containing summary of changes in ~50 characters (Vuln-ID)
2
3   Detailed explanation of the subject/header in ~75 words.
4   (what) Explain the security issue(s) that this commit is patching.
5   (why) Focus on why this patch is important and its impact.
6   (how) Describe how the issue is patched.
7
8   [For Each Weakness in Weaknesses:]
9   Weakness: weakness identification or CWE-ID.
10  Severity: severity of the issue (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
11  CVSS: numerical representation (0-10) of the vulnerability severity.
12  Detection: method used to detect the issue (Tool, Manual, Exploit).
13  Report: http://link-to-report/
14  Introduced in: commit hash.
15  [End]

Our research team confirmed that extracting security-related information from security commit messages may be difficult sometimes. The team found two main patterns: security commit messages are either poorly documented or do not seem to be security-related. This shows the importance of best practices and templates to create better security commit messages. Here are some of the examples the team found while looking at 
the data:
